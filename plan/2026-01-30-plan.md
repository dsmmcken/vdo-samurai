Todo list:

1. [x] Make the e2e tests include each starting a screen share before recording, and verify that the screen share badge appears on both peers. The screenshare should use the same techique to simulate the stream as the existing camera/mic streams, but label it on screenscreen as who is sharing, and be visually distinct from the camera/mic streams.

2. [x] Make an npm command that launches two electron apps at the same time for manually testing inter-process communication. It shoud use the same simulated video feeds as the e2e tests.

3. [x] The output in the editor should show the screenshare, with an overlayed camera tile in the bottom right corner of the video for the active user. When the active user changes, the overlayed screenshare and the overlayed camera tile should swap accordingly. This is what should be output in the final composite video as well.

4. [x] When a user joins a room with no peers, consider it the start of a new session, and reset any previous recording/edit state. Give it a unique internal session ID for tracking purposes. When peers join share with them the current session ID. Use that to determine if they are joining an existing session or a new one. Within a single session, all recording get shared to the editing timeline. If the users make additional recording to during the same session, append those to the timeline as well.
