Generate a plan to build a feature for adding a speeddial feature for hosts to play pre-recorded clips during recordings. It should support clip management (importing, deleting, organizing), and an easy-to-use interface for selecting and playing clips during a live recording session. The feature should also include options for adjusting clip volume. When a clip is play it should be visible to all participants as if it was the hosts screenshare. It should be captured as part of the timeline sequence, and inserted into the final composite video output.

The clips should be stored imported from locally on the hosts machine, they should be available as a speed dial button during the recording session. The host should be able to click a button to play the clip, and it should be streamed to all participants in the session. Switching the active tile should interupt it.

Make a plan to build this feature, broken down into clear steps with a todo list, and steps for you as the agent to verifiy each part is working correctly.

Ask questions if you need more information about the feature before generating the plan.
